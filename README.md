# Titanic Survial Analysis
Analyze Titnanic survival rate regarding age, gender, on boarding class ussing ggplot2 in R

#### Gender
Female survived disproportionately more than males down on the Titanic <br/>

#### On boarding class
First class passengers survival rate is much higher than the other two classes. <br/>

#### Gender vs. PClass
Female in first class overwhelmingly survived, same for second class female; half of third class female survived;
Male in first class has highest levels of survival ability, for second class, the survival rate is higher than third class but not as same as first class. Third class male has least chance of survival. <br/>
There are much more male passenger in third class than females <br/>

#### Histogram Analysis
Children and aged people disproportionately survived <br/>

#### Box Plot Analysis
People who survived are younger <br/>

#### Density Plot
Youngest children both girls and boys survived in second class
All young boys in first class are survived, boys in third class has 50/50 chance or survival rate <br/>
Girls in third class don’t have the survivability as boys in same class. <br/>

#### Histogram Analysis per gender
Only 3 female in first class are perished, all girls in second class are survived, girls in third class are disproportionately survived <br/>
Very few older people in third class survived <br/>

## Conclusion
The hypothesis of “women and children are first” is correct
